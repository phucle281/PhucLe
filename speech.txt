good morning, this is the second time i stand here. today i wanna share information about the air pollution these days.
you know, Vietnam is affected by Indonesia Hanoi just reached the 1st ranking of the world's most polluted city and HCM is not far behind.
so, i have 2 things to share
the 1st one i wanna introduce a mobile application called AirVisual
this app shows you quite exactly the air quality information around you at the current time. so, if the warning is high or extreame,
you can consider staying at home if you are not in urgent situation to protect yourself.
2nd is about the protection we use everyday. the mask.
You know, the 2 most dangerous dust at this time is PM2.5 and PM10 dust which affects extreamely our health. The mask we almost use, called medical mask,
can just protect us from common dust in the air, not PM2.5 and PM10 included. so, if you have free time, buy the more specific mask which
detailed preventing us from these 2 kinds of dangerous dust. You can easily search them in the Internet, the price is not really high so don't worry. I think it's worth.
That's all.
