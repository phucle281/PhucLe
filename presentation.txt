[3 - 4 mins]
Good morning everyone, I'm Phuc from Group 3.
Today, I'm going to show you our result of a week of team-working, about the I2C module.
So what's it? Let's begin.
At first, take a look at the Agenda which helps you get an overview of what I'm about to say.
I can summarize the content into 3 main sections - Overview, Register description and Operation.
So, I2C protocol, which means Inter-Integrated Circuit, is a synchronous serial interface
which is a very popular and powerful bus used for communication because of its simplicity.
---
I2C uses only two bidirectional open drain lines, Serial Data Line SDA and Serial Clock Line SCL,
pulled up with resistors.
---
The bus has two roles for nodes: master and slave:
1. Master node – node that generates the clock and initiates communication with slaves.
2. Slave node – node that receives the clock and responds when addressed by the master.
---
I2C defines basic types of transactions, each of which begins with a START condition and ends with a STOP condition:
1. Single message where a master writes data to a slave.
2. Single message where a master reads data from a slave.
3. Combined format, where a master issues at least two reads or writes to one or more slaves.

These figures show the structure of a transaction.
The gray blocks indicate ...
The white blocks indicate ...

The transaction will be introduced in more detail in the following sections
The START and STOP condition, ACK and NACK.

.. And some details of R-Car 3rd H3 Generation


3rd Generation R-Car series products have up to 7 I2C bus interfaces with information shown below.

Let's move to the next section with my teammate ..
